#### *Here is save my notes taken during online courses about CAN protocol.*

---

- **CAN = Controller Area Network**

Other names:
- CANBUS

- CAN bus

---

1. CAN is a **serial (cabel) network technology.**

2. CAN network is based on **bus topology.**

1. Originally, it was intended to automotive industry.

2. Create network of many devices (microcontrollers) with **just one (1) pair of wires**.

    *In other words, CAN enables **communication between microcontrollers with just 1 pair of wires***

3. Properties of CAN communication:
    - real time
    - fast
    - asynchronous 

4. Thanks to using just one pair of wires - CAN provides electrical noise (EMI) immunity.

5. In opposite to "conventional networks" - CAN infrustructure does not need wires dedicated to each of network devices - what was expensive and risk of electrical noise (EMI) was high.
