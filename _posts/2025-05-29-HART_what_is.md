---> <b><em>Highway</em></b>: This refers to the communication medium or "path" used for data transmission. In the context of HART, this could be a physical cable or wireless link

---> <b><em>Addressable</em></b>: Each device on the communication network is assigned a unique address. This allows the control system to communicate with individual devices directly, rather than broadcasting to all devices simultaneously.

---> <b><em>Remote</em></b>: The devices are typically located far from the central control system, often in hazardous or difficult-to-access locations, like in chemical plants or oil rigs.

---> <b><em>Transducer</em></b>: A transducer is a device that converts one type of energy into another. In the case of HART, it refers to sensors or instruments that convert physical quantities (like temperature, pressure, or flow) into electrical signals.

### <span style="color:orange">Main Functionalities</span> 
The HART protocol provides a reliable and flexible way to monitor and control industrial processes remotely, with both real-time data and advanced diagnostics.

The main functionalities are:
<ol>
<li><b><ins>Analog and Digital Communication</ins></b>: HART <b>allows both analog and digital communication over the same wires</b>. This is a unique feature that enables <b>continuous process control (analog signals)</b> along with additional <b>diagnostic and configuration data (digital signals)</b>.</li>
<br>
<li><ins><b>Two-way Communication</b></ins>: It supports two-way communication, meaning data can be both sent to and received from the field devices. This allows for configuration, calibration, diagnostics, and monitoring.</li>
<br>
<li><ins><b>Compatibility</b></ins>: HART is <b>backward compatible with traditional 4-20mA analog devices</b>, meaning we can still use HART-enabled devices in older systems that only support analog signals.</li>
<br>
<li><ins><b>Widely Used</b></ins>: HART is commonly used in industries such as oil & gas, chemical processing, pharmaceuticals, and power generation.</li>
