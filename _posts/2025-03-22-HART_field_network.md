### <span style="color:orange">Field Network Concept</span> 

- A field network, is also known as a fieldbus network, 

- is a <b>communication system</b> used in industrial automation <b>to connect various field devices, such as sensors</b>, actuators, and controllers, <b>to a central control system</b>. 

- it <b>allows these field devices to communicate with each other and with higher-level control systems, enabling efficient monitoring and control of industrial processes</b>.

### <span style="color:orange">Field Network Components</span> 
#### <span style="color:gray">Field Devices</span> 
These are the <b>devices located in the field (i.e., the industrial environment) that perform specific tasks</b>. 

Examples include:
- sensors (which measure temperature, pressure, etc.), 
- actuators (which control valves, motors, etc.), 
- and controllers (which process data and make decisions).

#### <span style="color:gray">Communication Protocol</span> 
<b>A set of rules and standards that define how data is transmitted and received over the network</b>. 

Common fieldbus protocols include PROFIBUS, Modbus, HART, and Foundation Fieldbus.
